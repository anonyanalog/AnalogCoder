I have the following implemented subcircuits you can directly call them by Python code with the Pyspice library, we list all basic information on them.

Now, you need to design [TASK]. Please maximize the design success rate, thus the circuit with two inputs and the highest possible gain has greater flexibility. Please choose the subcircuits from the above table you will use and make the number of chosen subcircuits as few as possible.

Please give out the IDs of the subcircuits that you choose, and enumerate them in a Python list like ```[0]```.
